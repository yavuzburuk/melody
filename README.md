# melody
Use Melody_Generator.jpynb to create melodies, render them as scores and midi files. YoÄ± have to choose the progression manually.

The other jpynb files are interim backup files (don't use them).

The code runs on Jupyter notebook running on Anaconda on Windows 11. MuseScore 3 and LilyPond must be installed in the computer to render the scores.
